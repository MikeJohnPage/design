    "text": "Welcome\nThe goal of this book is to help you write better R code. It has four main components:\n\nIdentifying design challenges that often lead to suboptimal outcomes.\nIntroducing useful patterns that help solve common problems.\nDefining key principles that help you balance conflicting patterns.\nDiscussing case studies that help you see how all the pieces fit together with real code.\n\nWhile I’ve called these principles “tidy” and they’re used extensively by the tidyverse team to promote consistency across our packages, they’re not exclusive to the tidyverse. Think tidy in the sense of tidy data (broadly useful regardless of what tool you’re using) not tidyverse (a collection of functions designed with a singular point of view in order to facilitate learning and use).\nThis book will be under heavy development for quite some time; currently we are loosely aiming for completion in 2025. You’ll find many chapters contain disjointed text that mostly serve as placeholders for the authors, and I do not recommend attempting to systematically read the book at this time. If you’d like to follow along with my journey writing this book, and learn which chapters are ready to read, please sign up for my tid design substack mailing list."

    "text": "1.1 Human centered\n\nPrograms must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\n— Hal Abelson\n\nProgramming is a task performed by humans. To create effective programming tools we must explicitly recognise and acknowledge the role played by cognitive psychology. This is particularly important for R, because it’s a language that’s used primarily by non-programmers, and we want to make it as easy as possible for first-time and end-user programmers to learn the tidyverse.\nA particularly useful tool from cognitive psychology is “cognitive load theory”1: we have a limited working memory, and anything we can do to reduce extraneous cognitive load helps the learner and user of the tidyverse. This motivates the next two principles:\n\nBy being consistent you only need to learn and internalise one expression of an idea, and then you can apply that many times.\nBy being composable you can break down complex problems into bite sized pieces that you can easily hold in your head.\n\nIdea of “chunking” is important. Some setup cost to learn a new chunk, but once you’ve internalised it, it only takes up one spot in your working memory. In some sense the goal of the tidyverse is to discover the minimal set of chunks needed to do data science and have some sense of the priority of the remainder.\nOther useful ideas come from design. One particularly powerful idea is that of “affordance”: the exterior of a tool should suggest how to use it. We want to avoid “Norman doors” where the exterior clues and cues point you in the wrong direction.\nThis principle is deeply connected to our beliefs about performance. Most importantly performance of code depends not only on how long it takes to run, but also how long it takes to write and read. Human brains are typically slower than computers, so this means we spend a lot of time thinking about how to create intuitve interfaces, focussing on writing and reading speed. Intuitive interfaces sometimes are at odds with running speed, because writing the fastest code for a problem often requires designing the interface for performance rather than usability. Generally, we optimise first for humans, then use profiling to discover bottlenecks that cause friction in data analysis. Once we have identified an important bottleneck, then performance becomes a priority and we rewrite the existing code. Generally, we’ll attempt to preserve the existing interface, only changing it when the performance implications are significant."

    "text": "1.2 Consistent\n\nA system should be built with a minimum set of unchangeable parts; those parts should be as general as possible; and all parts of the system should be held in a uniform framework.\n— Daniel H. H. Ingalls\n\nThe most important API principle of the tidyverse is to be consistent. We want to find the smallest possible set of key ideas and use them again and again. This is important because it makes the tidyverse easier to learn and remember.\n(Another framing of this principle is Less Volume, More Creativity, which comes from Mike McCarthy, the head coach of the Green Bay Packers, and popularised in Statistics Education by Randall Pruim)\nThis is related to one of my favourite saying from the Python community:\n\nThere should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.\n— Zen of Python\n\nThe tidyverse aspires to put this philosophy into practice. However, because the tidyverse is embedded within the larger R ecosystem, applying this principle never needs to be 100% comprehensive. If you can’t solve a problem from within the tidyverse, you can always step outside and do so with base R or another package. This also means that we don’t have to rush to cover every possible use case; we can take our time to develop the best new solutions.\nThe principle of consistency reveals itself in two primary ways: in function APIs and in data structures. The API of a function defines its external interface (independent of its internal implementation). Having consistent APIs means that each time you learn a function, learning the next function is a little easier; once you’ve mastered one package, mastering the next is easier.\nThere are two ways that we make functions consistent that are so important that they’re explicitly pull out as high-level principles below:\n\nFunctions should be composable: each individual function should tackle one well contained problem, and you solve complex real-world problems by composing many individual functions.\nOverall, the API should feel “functional”, which is a technical term for the programming paradigm favoured by the tidyverse\n\nBut consistency also applies to data structures: we want to ensure we use the same data structures again and again and again. Principally, we expect data to be stored in tidy data frames or tibbles. This means that tools for converting other formats can be centralised in one place, and that packages development is simplified by assuming that data is already in a standard format.\nValuing consistency is a trade-off, and we explicitly value it over performance. There are cases where a different data structure or a different interface might make a solution simpler to express or much faster. However, one-off solutions create a much higher cognitive load."

    "text": "1.3 Composable\n\nNo matter how complex and polished the individual operations are, it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines the power of the system.\n— Hal Abelson\n\nA powerful strategy for solving complex problems is to combine many simple pieces. Each piece should be easily understood in isolation, and have a standard way of combining with other pieces.\nWithin the tidyverse, we prefer to compose functions using a single tool: the pipe, %&gt;%. There are two notable exceptions to this principle: ggplot2 composes graphical elements with +, and httr composes requests primarily through .... These are not bad techniques in isolation, and they are well suited to the domains in which they are used, but the disadvantages of inconsistency outweigh any local advantages.\nFor smaller domains, this means carefully designing functions so that the inputs and outputs align (e.g. the output from stringr::str_locate() can easily be fed into str_sub()). For middling domains, this means drawing many feature matrices and ensuring that they are dense (e.g. consider the map family in purrr). For larger domains, this means carefully thinking about algebras and grammars, identifying the atoms of a problem and the ways in which they might be composed to solve bigger problems.\nWe decompose large problems into smaller, more tractable ones by creating and combining functions that transform data rather than by creating objects whose state changes over time.\nOther techniques that tend to facilitate composability:\n\nFunctions are data: this leads some of the most impactful techniques for functional programming, which allow you to reduce code duplication.\nImmutable objects. Enforces independence between components.\nPartition side-effects.\nType-stable."

Why? General name handling and repair can be implemented more simply if the baseline strategy guarantees that names(x) returns a character vector of the correct length with no NAs.\nThis is also a reasonable interpretation of base R’s intent for named vectors, based on the docs for names(), although base R’s implementation/enforcement of this is uneven. From ?names:\n\nThe name \"\" is special: it is used to indicate that there is no name associated with an element of a (atomic or generic) vector. Subscripting by \"\" will match nothing (not even elements which have no name).\nA name can be character NA, but such a name will never be matched and is likely to lead to confusion.\n\ntbl_df objects created by tibble::tibble() and tibble::as_tibble() have variable names that are minimal, at the very least."

    "text": "2.5 Unique names\nUnique names meet the requirements for minimal and have no duplicates. In the tidyverse, we go further and repair a few specific names: \"\" (the empty string), ... (R’s ellipsis or “dots” construct), and ..j where j is a number. They are basically all treated like \"\", which is always repaired.\nExample of unique-ified names:\n\n## original unique-ified\n##       \"\"         ...1\n##        x        x...2\n##       \"\"         ...3\n##      ...         ...4\n##        y            y\n##        x        x...6\n\nThis augmented definition of unique has a specific motivation: it ensures that each element can be identified by name, at least when protected by backtick quotes. Literally, all of these work:\n\ndf[[\"name\"]]\ndf$`name`\nwith(df, `name`)\nsubset(df, select = `name`)\ndplyr::select(df, `name`)\n\nThis has practical significance for variable names inside a data frame, because so many workflows rely on indexing by name. Note that uniqueness refers implicitly to a vector of names.\nLet’s explore a few edge cases: A single dot followed by a number, .j, does not need repair.\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(`.1` = \"ok\")\ndf$`.1`\n#&gt; [1] \"ok\"\nsubset(df, select = `.1`)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1\n#&gt;   `.1` \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 ok\ndplyr::select(df, `.1`)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1\n#&gt;   `.1` \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 ok\n\nTwo dots followed by a number, ..j, does need repair. The same goes for three dots, ..., the ellipsis or “dots” construct. These can’t function as names, even if quoted with backticks, so they have to be repaired.\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(`..1` = \"not ok\")\n#&gt; Error in `tibble()`:\n#&gt; ! Column 1 must not have names of the form ... or ..j.\n#&gt; Use `.name_repair` to specify repair.\n#&gt; Caused by error in `repaired_names()`:\n#&gt; ! Names can't be of the form `...` or `..j`.\n#&gt; ✖ These names are invalid:\n#&gt;   * \"..1\" at location 1.\nwith(df, `..1`)\n#&gt; Error in eval(substitute(expr), data, enclos = parent.frame()): ..1 used in an incorrect context, no ... to look in\ndplyr::select(df, `..1`)\n#&gt; Error in dot_call(capture_dots, frame_env = frame_env, named = named, : '...' used in an incorrect context\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(`...` = \"not ok\")\n#&gt; Error in `tibble()`:\n#&gt; !

We append a suffix of the form ...j to any name that is a duplicate or \"\" or ..., where j is the position. Why?\n\nAn absolute position j is more helpful than numbering within the elements that share a name. Context: troubleshooting data import with lots of columns and dysfunctional names.\nWe hypothesize that it’s better have a “level playing field” when repairing names, i.e. if foo appears twice, both instances get repaired, not just the second occurrence.\n\nThe unique level of naminess is regarded as normative for a tibble and a user must expressly request a tibble with names that violate this (but that is possible).\nBase R’s function for this is make.unique(). We revisit the example above, comparing the tidyverse strategy for making names unique vs. what make.unique() does.\n\n## Original Unique names     Result of\n##    names  (tidyverse) make.unique()\n##       \"\"         ...1            \"\"\n##        x        x...2             x\n##       \"\"         ...3            .1\n##      ...         ...4           ...\n##        y            y             y\n##        x        x...6           x.1\n\n\n2.5.2 Roundtrips\nWhen unique-ifying names, we assume that the input names have been repaired by the same strategy, i.e. that we are consuming dogfood. Therefore, pre-existing suffixes of the form ...j are stripped, prior to (re-)constructing the suffixes. If this interacts poorly with your names, you need to take control of name repair.\nExample of re-unique-ified names:\n\n##  original unique-ified\n##      ...5         ...1\n##         x        x...2\n##     x...3        x...3\n##        \"\"         ...4\n## x...1...5        x...5\n\nJB: it is conceivable that this should be under the control of an argument, e.g. dogfood = TRUE, in the (currently unexported) function that does this\n\n2.5.3 When is minimal better than unique?\nWhy would you ever want to import a tibble and enforce only minimal names, instead of unique? Sometimes the first row of a data source – allegedly variable names – actually contains data and the resulting tibble will be reshaped with, e.g., tidyr::gather(). In this case, it is better to not munge the names at import. This is a common special case of the “data stored in names” phenomenon.\nIn general, you may want to tolerate minimal names when the dysfunctional names are just an awkward phase that an object is passing through and a more definitive solution is applied downstream.\n\n2.5.4 Ugly, with a purpose\nYou might say that names like x...5 are ugly and you would be right. We’re calling this a feature, not a bug! Names that have been automatically unique-ified by the tidyverse should catch the eye and give the user strong encouragement to take charge of the situation.\n\n2.5.5 Why so many dots?\nThe suffix of ...j, with 3 leading dots, is the result of jointly satisfying multiple requirements. It is important to anticipate a missing name, where the suffix becomes the entire name. We have elected to make the suffix a syntactic name (more below), because non-syntactic names are a frequent cause of unexpected friction for users. This means the suffix can’t be j, .j, or ..j, because all are non-syntactic. It must be ...j.\n\n2.5.6 Why dot(s) in the first place?\nThe underscore _ was also considered when choosing the suffix strategy, but was rejected. Why? Because syntactic names can’t start with an underscore and we want the suffix itself to be syntactic. Also, the dot . is already used by base R’s make.names() to replace invalid characters. It seems simpler and, therefore, better to use the same character, in the same way, as much as possible in name repair. We use the dot ., we put it at the front, as many times as necessary."

For example, it does not require quoting in order to work with non-standard evaluation, such as list indexing via $, in a formula, or in packages like dplyr and ggplot2.\n\n## a syntactic name doesn't require quoting\nx &lt;- tibble::tibble(.else = \"else?!\")\nx$.else\n#&gt; [1] \"else?!\"\ndplyr::select(x, .else)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1\n#&gt;   .else \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; \n#&gt; 1 else?!\n\n\n## use a non-syntactic name\nx &lt;- tibble::tibble(`else` = \"else?!\")\n\n## this code does not parse\n# x$else\n# dplyr::select(x, else)\n\n## a non-syntacitic name requires quoting\nx$`else`\n#&gt; [1] \"else?!\"\ndplyr::select(x, `else`)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1\n#&gt;   `else`\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; \n#&gt; 1 else?!\n\nNote that being syntactic is a property of an individual name.\n\n2.6.2 Making an individual name syntactic\nThere are many ways to fix a non-syntactic name. Here’s how our logic compares to base::make.names() for a single name:\n\nSame: Definition of what is syntactically valid.\n\nClaim: If syn_name is a name that we have made syntactic, then syn_name == make.names(syn_name). If you find a counterexample, tell us!\n\n\nSame: An invalid character is replaced with a dot ..\nDifferent: We always fix a name by prepending a dot .. base::make.names() sometimes prefixes with X and at other times appends a dot ..\n\nThis means we turn ... into .... and ..j into ...j, where j is a number. base::make.names() does not modify ... or ..j, which could be regarded as a bug (?).\n\n\nDifferent: We treat NA and \"\" the same: both become .. This is because we first make names minimal. base::make.names() turns NA into \"NA.\" and \"\" into \"X\".\n\nExamples of the tidyverse approach to making individual names syntactic versus base::make.names():\n\n## Original Syntactic name    Result of\n##     name    (tidyverse) make.names()\n##       \"\"              .            X\n##       NA              .          NA.\n##      (y)            .y.         X.y.\n##       _z            ._z          X_z\n##     .2fa          ..2fa        X.2fa\n##    FALSE         .FALSE       FALSE.\n##      ...           ....          ...\n##      ..3           ...3          ..3\n\n\nCurrently implemented in the unexported function tibble:::make_syntactic().\n\n2.6.3 Why universal?\nNow we can state the motivation for universal names, which have the group-wise property of being unique and the element-wise property of being syntactic.\nIn practice, if you want syntactic names, you probably also want them to be unique. You need both in order to refer to individual elements easily, without ambiguity and without quoting.\nUniversal names can be requested in the tidyverse via .name_repair = \"universal\", in functions that expose name repair.\n\n2.6.4 Making names universal\nUniversal names are implemented as a variation on unique names. Basically, suffixes are stripped and ... is replaced with \"\". These draft names are transformed with tibble:::make_syntactic() (this step is omitted for unique names). Then ...j suffixes are appended as necessary.\nNote that suffix stripping and the substitution of \"\" for ... happens before the draft names are made syntactic. So, although tibble:::make_syntactic turns ... into ...., universal or unique name repair will turn ... into something of the form ...j."

Call usethis::use_partial_warnings() to make this the default for all R sessions.\n\noptions(warnPartialMatchArgs = TRUE)\nmean(x = 1:10, n = FALSE)\n#&gt; Warning in mean.default(x = 1:10, n = FALSE): partial argument match of 'n' to\n#&gt; 'na.rm'\n#&gt; [1] 5.5"

For example, in R for Data Science when we introduce ggplot2 we write code like:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nAt the end of the chapter, we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic structure and so the rest of the book uses the style recommended here:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(`displ, hwy)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nThere are also the occasional case when the first argument might be quite long, and there’s a couple of short options that you also want to set. If the long argument comes first, you may have to re-interpret what the function is doing when you finally hit the options. I think this comes up most often when an argument usually receives code inside of {} but it can crop up when manually generating data too.\n\nwriteLines(con = \"test.txt\", c(\n  \"line1\",\n  \"line2\",\n  \"line3\"\n))\n\nexpect_snapshot(error = TRUE, {\n  line1\n  line2\n  line3\n})"

If a function returns different results with the same inputs, then some inputs must be implicit, typically because the function relies on an option or some locale setting. Implicit inputs are not always bad, as some functions like Sys.time(), read.csv(), and the random number generators, fundamentally depend on them. But they should be used as sparingly as possible, and never when not related to the core purpose of the function.\nExplicit arguments make code easier to understand because you can see what will affect the outputs just by reading the code; you don’t need to run it. Implicit arguments can lead to code that returns different results on different computers, and the differences are usually hard to track down."

This option was part of a multi-year procedure to move R away toward character vectors and away from vectors. You can learn more in stringsAsFactors: An unauthorized biography by Roger Peng and stringsAsFactors = &lt;sigh&gt; by Thomas Lumley.\nlm()’s handling of missing values depends on the global option of na.action. The default is na.omit which drops the missing values prior to fitting the model (which is inconvenient because then the results of predict() don’t line up with the input data.\n\nAnother common source of subtle bugs is relying on the system locale, i.e. the country and language specific settings controlled by your operating system. Relying on the system locale is always done with the best of intentions (you want your code to respect the user’s preferences) but can lead to subtle differences when the same code is run by different people. Here are a few examples:\n\nstrptime() relies on the names of weekdays and months in the current locale. That means strptime(\"1 Jan 2020\", \"%d %b %Y\") will work on computers with an English locale, and fail elsewhere.\n\nas.POSIXct() depends on the current timezone. The following code returns different underlying times when run on different computers:\n\nas.POSIXct(\"2020-01-01 09:00\")\n#&gt; [1] \"2020-01-01 09:00:00 UTC\"\n\n\ntoupper() and tolower() depend on the current locale. It is fairly uncommon for this to cause problems because most languages either use their own character set, or use the same rules for capitalisation as English. However, this behaviour did cause a bug in ggplot2 because internally it takes geom = \"identity\" and turns it into GeomIdentity to find the object that actually does computation. In Turkish, however, the upper case version of i is İ, and Geomİdentity does not exist. This meant that for some time ggplot2 did not work on Turkish computers.\nsort() and order() rely on the lexicographic order (i.e. how different alphabets sort their letters) defined by the current locale. lm() automatically converts character vectors to factors with factor(), which uses order(), which means that it’s possible for the coefficients to vary2 if your code is run in a different country!"

But it’s easy for such problems to creep in indirectly, when you call a function not knowing that it has hidden inputs. The best way to prevent that is to consult the list of common offenders provided above.\n\n5.3.1 Make an option explicit\nIf you want depend on an option or locale, make sure it’s an explicit argument. Such arguments generally should not affect computation (Chapter 22), just side-effects like printed output or status messages. If they do affect results, follow Chapter 21 to make sure the user knows what’s happening. For example, lets take as.POSIXct() which basically looks something like this:\n\nas.POSIXct &lt;- function(x, tz = \"\") {\n  base::as.POSIXct(x, tz = tz)\n}\nas.POSIXct(\"2020-01-01 09:00\")\n#&gt; [1] \"2020-01-01 09:00:00 UTC\"\n\nThe tz argument is present, but it’s not obvious that \"\" means the current time zone. Let’s first make that explicit:\n\nas.POSIXct &lt;- function(x, tz = Sys.timezone()) {\n  base::as.POSIXct(x, tz = tz)\n}\nas.POSIXct(\"2020-01-01 09:00\")\n#&gt; [1] \"2020-01-01 09:00:00 UTC\"\n\nSince this is an important default whose value can change, we also print it out if the user hasn’t explicitly set it:\n\nas.POSIXct &lt;- function(x, tz = Sys.timezone()) {\n  if (missing(tz)) {\n    message(\"Using `tz = \\\"\", tz, \"\\\"`\")\n  }\n  base::as.POSIXct(x, tz = tz)\n}\nas.POSIXct(\"2020-01-01 09:00\")\n#&gt; Using `tz = \"UTC\"`\n#&gt; [1] \"2020-01-01 09:00:00 UTC\"\n\nSince most people don’t like lots of random output this provides a subtle incentive to supply the timezone:\n\nas.POSIXct(\"2020-01-01 09:00\", tz = \"America/Chicago\")\n#&gt; [1] \"2020-01-01 09:00:00 CST\"\n\n\n5.3.2 Temporarily adjust global state\nIf you’re calling a function with implicit arguments and those implicit arguments are causing problems with your code, you can always work around them by temporarily changing the global state which it uses. The easiest way to do so is to use the withr package, which provides a variety of tools to change temporarily change global state."

Fortunately, there are a few rules of thumb that can help:\n\nIf the output is a transformation of an input (e.g. log(), stringr::str_replace(), dplyr::left_join()) then that argument the most important.\nOther arguments that determine the type or shape of the output are typically very important.\nOptional arguments (i.e. arguments with a default) are the least important, and should come last.\n\nThis convention makes it easy to understand the structure of a function at a glance: the more important an argument is, the earlier you’ll see it. When the output is very strongly tied to an input, putting that argument first also ensures that your function works well with the pipe, leading to code that focuses on the transformations rather than the object being transformed."

I’d argue that data should be the first argument; while it doesn’t affect the shape of the output which is always an lm S3 object, it does affect the shape of many important functions like predict(). However, the designers of lm() wanted data to be optional, so you could still fit models even if you hadn’t collected the individual variables into a data frame. Because formula is required and data is not, this means that formula had to come first.\n\nThe first two arguments to ggplot() are data and mapping. Both data and mapping are required for every plot, so why make data first? I picked this ordering because in most plots there’s one dataset shared across all layers and only the mapping changes.\nOn the other hand, the layer functions, like geom_point(), flip the order of these arguments because in an individual layer you’re more likely to specify mapping than data, and in many cases if you do specify data you’ll want mapping as well. This makes these the argument order inconsistent with ggplot(), but overall supports the most common use cases.\n\nggplot2 functions work by creating an object that is then added on to a plot, so the plot, which is really the most important argument, is not obvious at all. ggplot2 works this way in part because it was written before the pipe was discovered, and the best way I came up to define plots from left to right was to rely on + (so-called operator overloading). As an interesting historical fact, ggplot (the precursor to ggplot2) actually works great with the pipe, and a couple of years ago I bought it back to life as ggplot1."

Because this is invasive to the user, it’s best to do sparingly: if the mistake is minor, you’re better off waiting until you’ve collected other problems before fixing it. For example, take tidyr::gather(). It has a number of problems with its design, including the argument order, that makes it harder to use.

In other words, an argument should have a default if and only if it’s optional.\nThis simple convention ensures that you can tell which arguments are optional and which arguments are required from a glance at the function signature. Otherwise you need to rely on a careful reading of documentation. Additionally, if you don’t follow this convention and want to provide helpful error messages, you’ll need to implement them yourself rather than relying on R’s defaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should an argument be required?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern raises the question of when an argument should be required, and when you should provide a default. I think this usually seems “obvious” but I wanted to discuss a few functions that might get it wrong:\n\nrnorm() and runif() are interesting cases as they set default values for mean/sd and min/max. Giving them defaults makes them feels like less important, and inconsistent with the other RNGs which generally require that you specify the parameters of the distribution. But both the normal and uniform distributions have very high-profile “standard” versions that make sense as defaults.\n\nYou can use predict() directly on a model and it gives predictions for the data used to fit the model:\n\nmod &lt;- lm(Employed ~ ., data = longley)\nhead(predict(mod))\n#&gt;     1947     1948     1949     1950     1951     1952 \n#&gt; 60.05566 61.21601 60.12471 61.59711 62.91129 63.88831\n\nIn my opinion, predict() should always require a dataset because prediction is primary about applying the model to new situations.\n\nstringr::str_sub() has default values for start and end. This allows you to do clever things like str_sub(x, end = 3) or str_sub(x, -3) to select the first or last three characters, but I now believe that leads to code that is harder to read, and it would have been better to make start and end required arguments."

    "text": "9.3 How do I use it?\nSo what should you do if a default requires some complex calculation? We have two recommended approaches: using NULL or creating a helper function. I’ll also show you two other alternatives which we don’t generally recommend but you’ll see in a handful of places in the tidyverse, and can be useful in limited circumstances.\n\n9.3.1 NULL default\nThe simplest, and most common, way to indicate that an argument is optional, but has a complex default is to use NULL as the default. Then in the body of the function you perform the actual calculation only if the is NULL. For example, if we were to use this approach in sample.int(), it might look something like this:\n\nsample.int &lt;- function (n, size = n, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL, useHash = NULL)  {\n  if (is.null(useHash)) {\n    useHash &lt;- n &gt; 1e+07 && !replace && is.null(prob) && size &lt;= n/2\n  }\n}\n\nThis pattern is made more elegant with the infix %||% operator which you can use by importing it from rlang or copying and pasting it in to your utils.R:\n\n`%||%` &lt;- function(x, y) if (is.null(x)) y else x\n\nsample.int &lt;- function (n, size = n, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL, useHash = NULL)  {\n  useHash &lt;- useHash %||% n &gt; 1e+07 && !replace && is.null(prob) && size &lt;= n/2\n}\n\n%||% is particularly well suited to arguments where the default value is found through a cascading system of fallbacks. For example, this code from ggplot2::geom_bar() finds the width by first looking at the data, then in the parameters, finally falling back to computing it from the resolution of the x variable:\n\nwidth &lt;- data$width %||% params$width %||% (resolution(data$x, FALSE) * 0.9)\n\nDon’t use %||% for more complex examples where the individual clauses can’t fit on their own line. For example in reshape(), I wouldn’t write:\n\nreshape &lt;- function(..., sep = \".\", split = NULL) {\n  split &lt;- split %||% if (sep == \"\") {\n    list(regexp = \"[A-Za-z][0-9]\", include = TRUE)\n  } else {\n    list(regexp = sep, include = FALSE, fixed = TRUE)\n  }  \n  ...\n}\n\nI would instead use is.null() and assign split inside each branch:\n\nreshape &lt;- function(..., sep = \".\", split = NULL) {\n  if (is.null(split)) {\n    if (sep == \"\") {\n      split &lt;- list(regexp = \"[A-Za-z][0-9]\", include = TRUE)\n    } else {\n      split &lt;- list(regexp = sep, include = FALSE, fixed = TRUE)\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\nOr alternatively you might pull the code out into a helper function:\n\nsplit_default &lt;- function(sep = \".\") {\n if (sep == \"\") {\n    list(regexp = \"[A-Za-z][0-9]\", include = TRUE)\n  } else {\n    list(regexp = sep, include = FALSE, fixed = TRUE)\n  }\n}\n\nreshape &lt;- function(..., sep = \".\", split = NULL) {\n  split &lt;- split %||% split_default(sep)\n  ...\n}\n\nThat makes it very clear exactly which other arguments the default for split depends on.\n\n9.3.2 Exported helper function\nIf you have created a helper function for your own use, might consider use it as the default:\n\nreshape &lt;- function(..., sep = \".\", split = split_default(sep)) {\n  ...\n}\n\nThe problem with using an internal function as the default is that the user can’t easily run this function to see what it does, making the default a bit magical (Chapter 20). So we recommend that if you want to do this you export and document that function. This is the main downside of this approach: you have to think carefully about the name of the function because it’s user facing.\nA good example of this pattern is readr::show_progress(): it’s used in every read_ function in readr to determine whether or not a progress bar should be shown. Because it has a relatively complex explanation, it’s nice to be able to document it in its own file, rather than cluttering up file reading functions with incidental details.\n\n9.3.3 Alternatives\nIf the above techniques don’t work for your case there are two other alternatives that we don’t generally recommend but can be useful in limited situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel value\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you’d like to use the NULL approach defined above, but NULL already has a specific meaning that you want to preserve. For example, this comes up in ggplot2 scales functions which allow you to set the name of the scale which is displayed on the axis or legend. The default value should just preserve whatever existing label is present so that if you’re providing a scale to customise (e.g.) the breaks or labels, you don’t need to re-type the scale name. However, NULL is also a meaningful value because it means eliminate the scale label altogether1. For that reason the default value for name is ggplot2::waiver() a ggplot2-specific convention that means “inherit from the existing value”.\nIf you look at ggplot2::waiver() you’ll see it’s just a very lightweight S3 class2:\n\nggplot2::waiver\n#&gt; function () \n#&gt; structure(list(), class = \"waiver\")\n#&gt; &lt;bytecode: 0x55bad632bdf8&gt;\n#&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:ggplot2&gt;\n\nAnd then ggplot2 also provides the internal is.waive()3 function which allows to work with it in the same way we might work with a NULL:\n\nis.waive &lt;- function(x) {\n  inherits(x, \"waiver\")\n}\n\nThe primary downside of this technique is that it requires substantial infrastructure to set up, so it’s only really worth it for very important functions or if you’re going to use it in multiple places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo default\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final alternative is to condition on the absence of an argument using missing(). It works something like this:\n\nreshape &lt;- function(..., sep = \".\", split) {\n  if (missing(split)) {\n    split &lt;- split_default(sep)\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\nI mention this technique because we used it in purrr::reduce() for the .init argument. This argument is mostly optional:\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Attaching package: 'purrr'\n#&gt; The following object is masked _by_ '.GlobalEnv':\n#&gt; \n#&gt;     %||%\nreduce(letters[1:3], paste)\n#&gt; [1] \"a b c\"\nreduce(letters[1:2], paste)\n#&gt; [1] \"a b\"\nreduce(letters[1], paste)\n#&gt; [1] \"a\"\n\nBut it is required when .x (the first argument) is empty, and it’s good practice to supply it when wrapping reduce() inside another function because it ensures that you get the right type of output for all inputs:\n\nreduce(letters[0], paste)\n#&gt; Error in `reduce()`:\n#&gt; ! Must supply `.init` when `.x` is empty.\nreduce(letters[0], paste, .init = \"\")\n#&gt; [1] \"\"\n\nWhy use this approach? NULL is a potentially valid option for .init, so we can’t use that approach. And we only need it for a single function, that’s not terribly important, so creating a sentinel didn’t seem to worth it. .init is “semi” required so this seemed to be the least worst solution to the problem.\nThe major drawback to this technique is that it makes it look like an argument is required (in direct conflict with Chapter 7)."

Inside the function, use match.arg() or rlang::arg_match() to check that the value comes from the known good set, and pick the default if none is suppled.\nTake rank(), for example. The heart of its implementation looks like this:\n\nrank &lt;- function(x, \n                 ties.method = \n                  c(\"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\", \"max\", \"min\")\n                 ) {\n  \n  ties.method &lt;- match.arg(ties.method)\n  \n  switch(ties.method, \n    average = , \n    min = , \n    max = .Internal(rank(x, length(x), ties.method)), \n    first = sort.list(sort.list(x)),\n    last = sort.list(rev.default(sort.list(x, decreasing = TRUE))), \n    random = sort.list(order(x, stats::runif(length(x))))\n  )\n}\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)\n\nrank(x)\n#&gt; [1] 1.0 2.5 2.5 5.0 5.0 5.0\nrank(x, ties.method = \"first\")\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\nrank(x, ties.method = \"min\")\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 2 4 4 4\n\nNote that match.arg() will automatically throw an error if the value is not in the set:\n\nrank(x, ties.method = \"middle\")\n#&gt; Error in match.arg(ties.method): 'arg' should be one of \"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\", \"max\", \"min\"\n\nIt also supports partial matching so that the following code is shorthand for ties.method = \"random\":\n\nrank(x, ties.method = \"r\")\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 3 5 4 6\n\nWe prefer to avoid partial matching because while it saves a little time writing the code, it makes reading the code less clear. rlang::arg_match() is an alternative to match.arg() that doesn’t support partial matching. It instead provides a helpful error message:\n\nrank2 &lt;- function(x, ties.method = c(\"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\", \"max\", \"min\")) {\n  ties.method &lt;- rlang::arg_match(ties.method)\n  rank(x, ties.method = ties.method)\n}\n\nrank2(x, ties.method = \"r\")\n#&gt; Error in `rank2()`:\n#&gt; ! `ties.method` must be one of \"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\",\n#&gt;   \"max\", or \"min\", not \"r\".\n#&gt; ℹ Did you mean \"random\"?\n\n# It also provides a suggestion if you misspell the argument\nrank2(x, ties.method = \"avarage\")\n#&gt; Error in `rank2()`:\n#&gt; ! `ties.method` must be one of \"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\",\n#&gt;   \"max\", or \"min\", not \"avarage\".\n#&gt; ℹ Did you mean \"average\"?\n\n\n10.3.1 How keep defaults short?\nThis technique is a best used when the set of possible values is short as otherwise you run the risk of dominating the function spec with this one argument (Chapter 9). If you have a long list of possibilities, there are three possible solutions:\n\n\nSet a single default and supply the possible values to match.arg()/arg_match():\n\nrank2 &lt;- function(x, ties.method = \"average\") {\n  ties.method &lt;- arg_match(\n    ties.method, \n    c(\"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\", \"max\", \"min\")\n  )\n}\n\n\n\nIf the values are used by many functions, you can store the options in an exported vector:\n\nties.methods &lt;- c(\"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\", \"max\", \"min\")\n\nrank2 &lt;- function(x, ties.method = ties.methods) {\n  ties.method &lt;- arg_match(ties.method)\n}\n\nFor example stats::p.adjust(), stats::pairwise.prop.test(), stats::pairwise.t.test(), stats::pairwise.wilcox.test() all use p.adjust.method = p.adjust.methods.\n\n\nYou can store the options in a exported named list2. That has the advantage that you can advertise both the source of the values, and the defaults, and the user gets a nice auto-complete of the possible values.\n\nlibrary(rlang)\nties &lt;- as.list(set_names(c(\"average\", \"first\", \"last\", \"random\", \"max\", \"min\")))\n\nrank2 &lt;- function(x, ties.method = ties$average) {\n  ties.method &lt;- arg_match(ties.method, names(ties))\n}"

    "text": "11.2 What are some examples?\n\n\nMany base R modelling functions like loess(), glm(), and nls() have a control argument that are paired with a function like loess.control(), glm.control(), and nls.control(). These allow you to modify rarely used defaults, including the number of iterations, the stopping criteria, and some debugging options.\noptim() uses a less formal version of this structure — while it has a control argument, it doesn’t have a matching optim.control() helper. Instead, you supply a named list with components described in ?optim. A helper function is more convenient than a named list because it checks the argument names for free and gives nicer autocomplete to the user.\n\nThis pattern is common in other modelling packages, e.g. tune::fit_resamples() + tune::control_resamples(), tune::control_bayes(), tune::control_grid(), and caret::train() + caret::trainControl()\nreadr::read_delim() and friends take a locale argument which is paired with the readr::locale() helper. This object bundles together a bunch of options related to parsing numbers, dates, and times that vary from country to country.\nreadr::locale() itself has a date_names argument that’s paired with readr::date_names() and readr::date_names_lang() helpers. You typically use the argument by supplying a two letter locale (which date_names_lang() uses to look up common languages), but if your language isn’t supported you can use readr::date_names() to individually supply full and abbreviated month and day of week names.\n\nOn the other hand, some functions with many arguments that would benefit from this technique include:\n\nreadr::read_delim() has a lot of options that control rarely needed details of file parsing (e.g. escape_backslash, escape_double, quoted_na, comment, trim_ws). These make the function specification very long and might well be better in a details object.\nggplot2::geom_smooth() fits a smooth line to your data. Most of the time you only want to pick the model and formula used, but geom_smooth() (via ggplot2::stat_smooth()) also provides n, fullrange, span, level, and method.args to control details of the fit. I think these would be better in their own details object."

    "text": "12.3 How do I use this pattern?\nThe simplest approach to exposing different strategies is give each approach a name, then use an enumeration to pick between them, as described in Chapter 10. For simple implementations you can then use switch() to pick between them. For example, take stringr::str_trim(), which looks something like this:\n\nstr_trim &lt;- function (string, side = c(\"both\", \"left\", \"right\")) \n{\n  switch(\n    arg_match(side),\n    left = stri_trim_left(string),\n    right = stri_trim_right(string),\n    both = stri_trim_both(string)\n  )\n}\n\nThis is particularly simple because stringr relies on the stringi package for its implementation. But it’s still straightforward even if we implement it “by hand” with regular expressions:\n\nstr_trim &lt;- function (string, side = c(\"both\", \"left\", \"right\")) \n{\n  pattern &lt;- switch(\n    arg_match(side),\n    left = \"^\\\\s+\",\n    right = \"\\\\s$\",\n    both = \"^\\\\s+|\\\\s$\"\n  )\n  str_replace_all(string, pattern, \"\")\n}\n\nIf the implementation of each strategy doesn’t fit on one line you could make helper functions where most of the implementation lives or you could use if statements.\n\n12.3.1 Escape hatch\nIt’s sometimes useful to build in an escape hatch from canned strategies. This allows users to access alternative strategies, and allows for experimentation that can later turn into a official strategies. One example of such an escape hatch is in name repair, which occurs in many places throughout the tidyverse. One place you might encounter it is in tibble():\n\ntibble::tibble(a = 1, a = 2)\n#&gt; Error in `tibble::tibble()`:\n#&gt; ! Column name `a` must not be duplicated.\n#&gt; Use `.name_repair` to specify repair.\n#&gt; Caused by error in `repaired_names()`:\n#&gt; ! Names must be unique.\n#&gt; ✖ These names are duplicated:\n#&gt;   * \"a\" at locations 1 and 2.\n\nBeneath the surface all tidyverse functions that expose some sort of name repair eventually end up calling vctrs::vec_as_names():\n\nvctrs::vec_as_names(c(\"a\", \"a\"), repair = \"check_unique\")\n#&gt; Error:\n#&gt; ! Names must be unique.\n#&gt; ✖ These names are duplicated:\n#&gt;   * \"a\" at locations 1 and 2.\nvctrs::vec_as_names(c(\"a\", \"a\"), repair = \"unique\")\n#&gt; New names:\n#&gt; • `a` -&gt; `a...1`\n#&gt; • `a` -&gt; `a...2`\n#&gt; [1] \"a...1\" \"a...2\"\nvctrs::vec_as_names(c(\"a\", \"a\"), repair = \"unique_quiet\")\n#&gt; [1] \"a...1\" \"a...2\"\n\nvec_as_names() exposes six strategies, but it also allows you to supply a function:\n\nvctrs::vec_as_names(c(\"a\", \"a\"), repair = toupper)\n#&gt; [1] \"A\" \"A\""

In hindsight, it’s very obvious that there are other things that you might want to do on error other than cancel, and even though I don’t know what they are know, it would be better to design for the future.\nhaven::write_sav() started with a compress argument that could be either TRUE (compress the file) or FALSE (don’t compress the file). But then SPSS introduced a new way of compressing files leading to three possible options: compress with the new way, compress with the old way, or don’t compress. We’ll discuss what we did to remediate the problem below.\n\nAnother interesting case is sort() which has two arguments that take a single logical value: decreasing and na.last.\n\n\ndecreasing is interesting to think about because it picks between two directions: ascending and descending. It’s extremely unlikely that we’d ever need a third direction, but I think there’s still benefit in using the strategy pattern here because I think it makes the arguments mildly easier to understand. For example, compare the interfaces of sort() and vctrs::vec_sort():\n\nx &lt;- sample(10)\nsort(x, decreasing = TRUE)\nvctrs::vec_sort(x, direction = \"desc\")\n\nsort(x, decreasing = FALSE)\nvctrs::vec_sort(x, direction = \"asc\")\n\nWhile you never need to explicitly right decreasing = FALSE (since that’s the default), I think it’s easier to understand direction = \"asc\" than trying to process what not-decreasing means.\n\nThe na.last argument to sort() can be TRUE (put NAs at the end), FALSE (put NAs at the beginning), or NA (drop NAs from the result).

    "text": "13.3 How do you remediate past mistakes?\nThere are two possible ways to switch to using a strategy instead of TRUE/FALSE depending on whether the old argument name still makes sense with the new argument values. The sections below show what you’ll need to do if you need a new argument (most cases) or if you’re lucky enough to be able to reuse the existing argument.\n\n13.3.1 New argument\nImagine we wanted to remediate the na.last argument to sort():\n\n\nna.last = TRUE means put NAs last.\n\nna.last = FALSE means put NAs first.\n\nna.list = NA means to drop them.\n\nI think we could make this function more clear by changing the argument name to na and accepting one of three values: last, first, or drop. Changing an argument name is equivalent removing the old name and adding the new name. This way of thinking about the change makes it easier to see how you do it in a backward compatible way: you you just need deprecate the old argument in favour of the new one.\n\nsort &lt;- function(x, \n                 na.last = lifecycle::deprecated(), \n                 na = c(\"drop\", \"first\", \"last\")) \n{\n  if (lifecycle::is_present(na.last)) {\n    lifecycle::deprecate_warn(\"1.0.0\", \"sort(na.last)\", \"sort(na)\")\n\n    if (!is.logical(na.last) || length(na.last) != 1) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"{.arg na.last} must be a single TRUE, FALSE, or NA.\")\n    }\n    \n    if (isTRUE(na.last)) {\n      na &lt;- \"last\"\n    } else if (isFALSE(na.last)) {\n      na &lt;- \"first\"\n    } else {\n      na &lt;- \"drop\"\n    }\n  } else {\n    na &lt;- arg_match(na)\n  }\n  \n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that because na is a prefix of na.last and sort() puts na.last before …,not after it (see Chapter 8), this introduces a very subtle behaviour change. Previously, sort(x, n = TRUE) would have worked and been equivalent to sort(x, na.last = TRUE). But now it will fail, because n is a prefix of two arguments (na and na.last). This is unlikely to affect much code, but is something that you need to consider.\nIt would also be nice to make the default value \"last\" to match order(), especially since it’s very unusual for a function to silently remove missing values. However, that’s likely to affect a lot of existing code, meaning that it’s unlikely to be worthwhile.\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Re-use existing name\nWhen remediating a old mistake sometimes you get lucky and you can use the same argument name, as with haven::write_sav(). When SPSS version 21.0 introduced a new form of compression (called zsav), we changed the compress argument from accepting TRUE or FALSE to accepting, “none”, “byte”, or “zsav” because compress = TRUE reads just as well as compress = \"byte\". To implement thiis we kept the existing behaviour for TRUE and FALSE while also adding the ability to supply a string:\n\nwrite_sav &lt;- function(data, path, compress = c(\"byte\", \"none\", \"zsav\"), adjust_tz = TRUE) {\n  if (isTRUE(compress)) {\n    compress &lt;- \"zsav\"\n  } else if (isFALSE(compress)) {\n    compress &lt;- \"none\"\n  } else {\n    compress &lt;- arg_match(compress)\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nYou could choose to deprecate TRUE and FALSE, but here we chose to the keep them since it’s only a small amount of extra code in haven, and it means that existing users don’t need to think about it. See ?haven::read_sav for how we communicated the change in the docs."

When this happens it’s best to make each strategy it’s own function to make it as clear as possible which arguments belong to which strategy. One sign that this pattern is needed is a complex dependency pattern between arguments: maybe you can set a and b and a and c but not b and c. This tends to make the function harder to use because it suggests more viable input combination that actually exist. You have to learn and the remember the set of allowed combinations, rather that seeing the underlying strategies.\nThere are two variations of this pattern depending on how much arguments are shared across all the strategies. If many arguments are shared, you might create a strategy object that is used in conjunction with another function; if few arguments are shared you might split into multiple top-level functions."

This allows the function name to hint at the purpose, prevents you from supplying both n and prop through the design of the functions, and only has the ties.method argument where it makes sense.\nrep() exposes two basic strategies: repeat each element of the vector (by setting each to a scalar or times to a vector) or repeat the entire vector (by setting times to a scalar).

    "text": "14.3 How do you use the pattern?\nIn more complicated cases, different strategies will require different arguments, so you’ll need a bit more infrastructure. The basic idea is build on the options object described in Chapter 11, but instead of providing just one helper function, you’ll provide one function per strategy. A good example of this approach is readr, which provides regex(), boundary(), coll(), and fixed() to pick between four different strategies for matching text. You can learn more about why we picked that interface in Chapter 19, so here I wanted to focus on the implementation.\nIf you take a look at one of these functions, you’ll see it’s a wrapper around a stringi function that performs a similar job. But fixed() does two extra things compared to stri_opts_fixed(): it more aggressively checks the input arguments and it combines the stringi options with the pattern and adds a class.\n\nfkxed &lt;- function(pattern, ignore_case = FALSE) {\n  pattern &lt;- as_bare_character(pattern)\n  check_bool(ignore_case)\n\n  options &lt;- stri_opts_fixed(case_insensitive = ignore_case)\n\n  structure(\n    pattern,\n    options = options,\n    class = c(\"stringr_fixed\", \"stringr_pattern\", \"character\")\n  )\n}\n\nThis class is important because it allows us to check that the user has provided the expect input type and give a useful error message if not. Since pretty much every stringr function needs to do this, stringr provides a internal function called type() that looks something like this1:\n\ntype &lt;- function(x) {\n  if (inherits(x, \"stringr_boundary\")) {\n    \"bound\"\n  } else if (inherits(x, \"stringr_regex\")) {\n    \"regex\"\n  } else if (inherits(x, \"stringr_coll\")) {\n    \"coll\"\n  } else if (inherits(x, \"stringr_fixed\")) {\n    \"fixed\"\n  } else if (is.character(x)) {\n    if (identical(x, \"\")) \"empty\" else \"regex\"\n  } else {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Must be a string or stringr pattern object\")\n  }\n}\n\nThen individual stringr functions can use type() plus a switch statement:\n\nstr_detect &lt;- function(string, pattern) {\n  check_lengths(string, pattern)\n  check_bool(negate)\n\n  switch(type(pattern),\n1    empty = no_empty(),\n    bound = no_boundary(),\n2    fixed = stri_detect_fixed(string, pattern, opts_fixed = opts(pattern)),\n    coll  = stri_detect_coll(string,  pattern, opts_collator = opts(pattern)),\n    regex = stri_detect_regex(string, pattern, opts_regex = opts(pattern))\n  )\n}\n\n\n1\n\nno_empty() and no_boundary() are helper functions that generate errors when a stringr function doesn’t support a specific engine.\n\n2\n\nopts() is a helper function for extracting the stringi options back out of the stringr wrapper object.\n\n\n\n\nYou can implement this same strategy using if or OOP, but here I particularly like the switch pattern because it keeps the stringi function calls close together, which makes it easier to keep them in sync.\n\n14.3.1 Using a strategy function\nSometimes the strategy will be tangled in with many other arguments, or they might be multiple strategies used simultaneously. In these situations you want to avoid creating a combinatorial explosion of functions, and instead might want to use a strategy object.\nFor example, generating the bins for a histogram is a surprisingly complex topic. ggplot2::stat_bin(), which powers ggplot2::geom_histogram(), has a total of 5 arguments that control where the bins are placed:\n\nYou can supply either binwidth or bins to specify either the width or the number of evenly spaced bins. Alternatively, you supply breaks to specify the exact bin locations yourself (which allows you to create unevenly sized bins2).\nIf you use binwidth or bins, you’re specifying the width of each bin, but not where the bins start. So additionally you can use either boundary or center3 to specify the location of a side (boundary) or the middle (center) of a bin4. boundary and center are mutually exclusive; you can only specify one (see Chapter 17 for more).\nRegardless of the way that you specify the locations of the bins, you need to choose where a bin from a to b, is [a, b) or (a, b], which is the job of the closed argument.\n\nOne way to resolve this problem would encapsulate the three basic strategies into three functions:\n\nbin_width(width, center, boundary, closed)\nbin_number(bins, center, boundary, closed)\nbin_breaks(breaks, closed)\n\nThat immediately makes the relationship between the arguments and the strategies more clear.\nNote that these functions create “strategies”; i.e. they don’t take the data needed to actual perform the operation — none of these functions take range of the data. This makes these functions function factories, which is a relatively complex technique.\n\nbin_width &lt;- function(width, center, boundary, closed = c(\"left\", \"right\")) {\n  # https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html#forcing-evaluation\n  list(width, center, boundary, closed)\n  \n  function(range) {\n    \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Argument checking\nAs in Chapter 11, you may want to give these functions custom classes so that the function that uses them can provide better error messages if the user supplies the wrong type of object.\nAlternatively, you might want to just check that the input is a function with the correct formals; that allows the user to supply their own strategy function. It’s probably something that few people will take advantage of, but it’s a nice escape hatch."

Another possibility would be rep_every() since each and every form a natural pair, but to me at least, repeating “every” element doesn’t feel very different to repeating each element.\nNext, we need to think about their arguments. Both will have a single data argument: x, the vector to repeat. rep_each() has an additional argument that specifies the number of times to replicate each element, which can either be a single number, or a vector the same length as x. rep_time() has two mutually exclusive details arguments (Chapter 17), the number of times to repeat the whole vector, or the desired length of the output.\nWhat should we call the arguments? We’ve already captured the different replication strategies (each vs. full) in the function name, so I think the argument that specifies the number of times to replicate can be the same, and times seems reasonable. For the second argument to rep_full(), I draw inspiration from rep() which uses length.out. I think it’s obvious that the argument controls the output, so length is adequate.\n\nrep_each &lt;- function(x, times) {\n  times &lt;- vctrs::vec_recycle(times, length(x))\n  rep(x, times = times)\n}\n\nrep_full &lt;- function(x, times, length) {\n  rlang::check_exclusive(times, length)\n  \n  if (!missing(length)) {\n    rep(x, length.out = length)\n  } else {\n    rep(x, length.out = times * base::length(x))\n  }\n}\n\n(Note the downside of using length as the argument name: we have to call base::length() to avoid evaluating the missing length when times is supplied. This is probably why rep() uses length.out.)\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 4)\n\nrep_each(x, times = 2)\n#&gt; [1] 1 1 2 2 4 4\nrep_full(x, times = 2)\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 4 1 2 4\n\nrep_each(x, times = x)\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 2 4 4 4 4\n\nrep_full(x, length = 5)\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 4 1 2\n\nOne downside of this approach is if you want to both replicate each component and the entire vector, you have to use two function calls, which is much more verbose than the rep() equivalent. However, I don’t think this is a terribly common use case, and so I think a longer call is more readable."

In base R you need to know about do.call(rbind, mylist) which is a relatively sophisticated pattern. So in dplyr we tried to make bind_rows() automatically figure out if you were in situation one or two.\nUnfortunately, it turns out to be really hard to tell which of the situations you are in, so dplyr implemented heuristics that work most of the time, but occasionally it fails in surprising ways.\nNow we have generally steered away from interfaces that try to automatically “unsplice” their inputs and instead require that you use !!! to explicitly unsplice. This is has some advantages and disadvantages: it’s an interface that’s becoming increasingly common in the tidyverse (and we have a good convention for documenting it with the &lt;dynamic-dots&gt; tag), but it’s still relatively rare and is an advanced technique that we don’t expect everyone to learn.

This also has the nice feature of making it easier to extend in the future. That might look something like this:\n\ngrepl(pattern, string, engine = \"regex\")\ngrepl(pattern, string, engine = \"fixed\")\ngrepl(pattern, string, engine = \"perl\")\n\nBut stringr takes a different approach, because of a problem hinted at in grepl() and friends: ignore.case only works with two of the three engines: POSIX and perl. Additionally, having an engine argument that affects the meaning of the pattern argument is a little unfortunate — that means you have to read the call until you see the engine argument before you can understand precisely what the pattern means.\nstringr takes a different approach, encoding the engine as an attribute of the pattern:\n\nx &lt;- str_detect(letters, \"a\")\n# short for:\nx &lt;- str_detect(letters, regex(\"a\"))\n\n# Which is where you supply additional arguments\nx &lt;- str_detect(letters, regex(\"a\", ignore_case = TRUE))\n\nThis has the advantage that each engine can take different arguments. In base R, the only argument of this nature of ignore.case, but stringr’s regex() has arguments like multiline, comments, and dotall which change how some components of the pattern are matched.\nUsing an engine argument also wouldn’t work in stringr because of the boundary() engine which rather than matching specific patterns uses matches based on boundaries between things like letters or words or sentences.\n\nstr_view(\"This is a sentence.\", boundary(\"word\"))\nstr_view(\"This is a sentence.\", boundary(\"sentence\"))\n\nThis is more appealing than creating a separate function for each engine because there are many other functions in the same family as grepl().

For example, in file.copy() overwrite defaults to the same value as recursive, but the recursive argument is defined after overwrite:\n\nargs(file.copy)\n#&gt; function (from, to, overwrite = recursive, recursive = FALSE, \n#&gt;     copy.mode = TRUE, copy.date = FALSE) \n#&gt; NULL\n\nThis makes the defaults arguments harder to understand because you can’t just read from left-to-right."

You can determine the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind, and so on). You can determine the precise specifications of the cartridges and bullets you are using, and their interactions with the actual gun you are firing. You can then use tables or a firing computer to calculate the exact bearing and elevation of the barrel. If everything works exactly as specified, your tables are correct, and the environment doesn’t change, your bullets should land close to their target.\nOr you could use tracer bullets.\nTracer bullets are loaded at intervals on the ammo belt alongside regular ammunition. When they’re fired, their phosphorus ignites and leaves a pyrotechnic trail from the gun to whatever they hit. If the tracers are hitting the target, then so are the regular bullets.\n— The Pragmatic Programmer\n\nI think this is a valuable pattern because it helps balance two tensions in function design:\n\nForcing the function user to really think about what they want to do.\nTrying to be helpful, so the user of function can achieve their goal as quickly as possible.\n\nOften your thoughts about a problem will be aided by a first attempt, even if that attempt is wrong. Helps facilitate iteration: you don’t sit down and contemplate for an hour and then write one perfectly formed line of R code. You take a stab at it, look at the result, and then tweak.\nTaking a default that the user really should carefully think about and make a decision on, and turning it into a heurstic or educated guess, and reporting the value, is like a tracer bullet.\nThe counterpoint to this pattern is that people don’t read repeated output. For example, do you know how to cite R in a paper? It’s mentioned every time that you start R. Human brains are extremely good at filtering out unchanging signals, which means that you must use this technique with caution. If every argument tells you the default it uses, it’s effectively the same as doing nothing: the most important signals will get buried in the noise. This is why you’ll see the technique used in only a handful of places in the tidyverse."

This automatically adds an on exit handler, which checks that ever element of ... has been evaluated just prior to the function returnning.\nYou can see this in action by creating a safe wrapper around cut(), which has different arguments for its numeric and date methods.\n\nsafe_cut &lt;- function(x, breaks, ..., right = TRUE) {\n  rlang::check_dots_used()\n  UseMethod(\"safe_cut\")\n}\n\nsafe_cut.numeric &lt;- function(x, breaks, ..., right = TRUE, include.lowest = FALSE) {\n  cut(x, breaks = breaks, right = right, include.lowest = include.lowest)\n}\n\nsafe_cut.Date &lt;- function(x, breaks, ..., right = TRUE, start.on.monday = TRUE) {\n  cut(x, breaks = breaks, right = right, start.on.monday = start.on.monday)\n}\n\n\n25.3.1 What are the limitations?\nAccurately detecting this problem is hard because no one place has all the information needed to tell if an argument is superfluous or not (the precise details are beyond the scope of this text). Instead rlang takes advantage of R’s lazy evaluation and inspects the internal components of ... to see if their evaluation has been forced.\nIf a function is called primarily for its side-effects, the error will occur after the side-effect has happened, making for a confusing result. Here the best we can do is a warning, generated by rlang::check_dots_used(error = function(e) warn(e))\nIf a function captures the components of ... using enquo() or match.call(), you can not use this technique. This also means that if you use check_dots_used(), the method author can not choose to add a quoted argument. I think this is ok because quoting vs. evaluating is part of the interface of the generic, so methods should not change this interface, and it’s fine for the author of the generic to make that decision for all method authors.\n\n25.3.2 What are other uses?\nThis same technique can also be used when you are wrapping other functions. For example, stringr::str_sort() takes ... and passes it on to stringi::stri_opts_collator(). As of March 2019, str_sort() looked like this:\n\nstr_sort &lt;- function(x, decreasing = FALSE, na_last = TRUE, locale = \"en\",  numeric = FALSE, ...) \n{\n    stringi::stri_sort(x, \n      decreasing = decreasing, \n      na_last = na_last, \n      opts_collator = stringi::stri_opts_collator(\n        locale, \n        numeric = numeric, \n        ...\n      )\n    )\n}\n\n\nx &lt;- c(\"x1\", \"x100\", \"x2\")\nstr_sort(x)\n#&gt; [1] \"x1\"   \"x100\" \"x2\"\nstr_sort(x, numeric = TRUE)\n#&gt; [1] \"x1\"   \"x2\"   \"x100\"\n\nThis is wrapper is useful because it decouples str_sort() from the stri_opts_collator() meaning that if stri_opts_collator() gains new arguments users of str_sort() can take advantage of them immediately. But most of the arguments in stri_opts_collator() are sufficiently arcane that they don’t need to be exposed directly in stringr, which is designed to minimise the cognitive load of the user, by hiding some of the full complexity of string handling.\n(The importance of the locale argument comes up in “hidden inputs”, Chapter 5.)\nHowever, stri_opts_collator() deliberately ignores any arguments in .... This means that misspellings are silently ignored:\n\nstr_sort(x, numric = TRUE)\n#&gt; Warning in stringi::stri_opts_collator(locale, numeric = numeric, ...): Unknown\n#&gt; option to `stri_opts_collator`.\n#&gt; [1] \"x1\"   \"x100\" \"x2\"\n\nWe can work around this behaviour by adding check_dots_used() to str_sort():\n\nstr_sort &lt;- function(x, decreasing = FALSE, na_last = TRUE, locale = \"en\",  numeric = FALSE, ...) \n{\n    rlang::check_dots_used()\n  \n    stringi::stri_sort(x, \n      decreasing = decreasing, \n      na_last = na_last, \n      opts_collator = stringi::stri_opts_collator(\n        locale, \n        numeric = numeric, \n        ...\n      )\n    )\n}\n\nstr_sort(x, numric = TRUE)\n#&gt; Warning in stringi::stri_opts_collator(locale, numeric = numeric, ...): Unknown\n#&gt; option to `stri_opts_collator`.\n#&gt; Error in `str_sort()`:\n#&gt; ! Arguments in `...` must be used.\n#&gt; ✖ Problematic argument:\n#&gt; • numric = TRUE\n#&gt; ℹ Did you misspell an argument name?\n\nNote, however, that it’s better to figure out why stri_opts_collator() ignores ... in the first place.

I think this is the correct behaviour because you usually add names to a vector to create a lookup table, and a lookup table is not useful if there are duplicated names.

Currently the function is only useful for setting names to a constant. Maybe we could extend it to also make it easier to change existing names? One way to do that would be to allow names to be a function:\n\nset_names &lt;- function(x, names = x) {\n  vec_assert(x)\n  \n  if (is.function(names)) {\n    names &lt;- names(base::names(x))\n  }\n  vec_assert(names, ptype = character(), size = length(x))\n\n  names(x) &lt;- names\n  x\n}\n\nx &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)\nset_names(x, toupper)\n#&gt; A B C \n#&gt; 1 2 3\n\nWe could also support anonymous function formula shortcut used in many places in the tidyverse.\n\nset_names &lt;- function(x, names = x) {\n  vec_assert(x)\n  \n  if (is.function(names) || rlang::is_formula(names)) {\n    fun &lt;- rlang::as_function(names)\n    names &lt;- fun(base::names(x))\n  }\n  vec_assert(names, ptype = character(), size = length(x))\n\n  names(x) &lt;- names\n  x\n}\n\nx &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)\nset_names(x, ~ paste0(\"x-\", .))\n#&gt; x-a x-b x-c \n#&gt;   1   2   3\n\nNow set_names() supports overriding and modifying names. What about removing them? It turns out that setNames() supported this, but our stricter checks prohibit:\n\nx &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)\nsetNames(x, NULL)\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 3\nset_names(x, NULL)\n#&gt; Error in `set_names()`:\n#&gt; ! `names` must be a vector, not `NULL`.\n\nWe can fix this with another clause:\n\nset_names &lt;- function(x, names = x) {\n  vec_assert(x)\n  \n  if (!is.null(names)) {\n    if (is.function(names) || rlang::is_formula(names)) {\n      fun &lt;- rlang::as_function(names)\n      names &lt;- fun(base::names(x))\n    }\n    \n  }\n\n  names(x) &lt;- names\n  x\n}\n\nx &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)\nset_names(x, NULL)\n#&gt; [1] 1 2 3\n\nHowever, I think this has muddied the logic. To resolve it, I think we should pull out the checking code into a separate function. After trying out a few approaches, I ended up with:\n\ncheck_names &lt;- function(names, x) {\n  if (is.null(names)) {\n    names\n  } else if (vec_is(names)) {\n    vec_assert(names, ptype = character(), size = length(x))  \n  } else if (is.function(names)) {\n    check_names_2(names(base::names(x)), x)\n  } else if (rlang::is.formula(names)) {\n    check_names_2(rlang::as_function(names), x)\n  } else {\n    rlang::abort(\"`names` must be NULL, a function or formula, or a vector\")\n  }\n}\n\nThis then replaces vec_assert() in set_names(). I separate the input checking and implementation with a blank line to help visually group the parts of the function.\n\nset_names &lt;- function(x, names = x) {\n  vec_assert(x)\n  names &lt;- check_names(names, x)\n  \n  names(x) &lt;- names\n  x\n}\n\nWe could simplify the function even further, but I think this is a bad idea becaues it mingles input validation with implementation:\n\n# Don't do this\nset_names &lt;- function(x, names = x) {\n  vec_assert(x)\n  names(x) &lt;- check_names(names, x)\n  x\n}\n\n# Or even\nset_names &lt;- function(x, names = x) {\n  `names&lt;-`(vec_assert(x), check_names(names, x))\n}"

    "text": "29.3 Challenge: the median\nA more challenging example is median(). The median of a vector is a value that (as evenly as possible) splits the vector into a lower half and an upper half. In the absence of ties, mean(x &gt; median(x)) == mean(x &lt;= median(x)) == 0.5. The median is straightforward to compute for odd lengths: you simply order the vector and pick the value in the middle, i.e. sort(x)[(length(x) - 1) / 2]. It’s clear that the type of the output should be the same type as x, and this algorithm can be applied to any vector that can be ordered.\nBut what if the vector has an even length? In this case, there’s no longer a unique median, and by convention we usually take the mean of the middle two numbers.\nIn R, this makes the median() not type-stable:\n\ntypeof(median(1:3))\n#&gt; [1] \"integer\"\ntypeof(median(1:4))\n#&gt; [1] \"double\"\n\nBase R doesn’t appear to follow a consistent principle when computing the median of a vector of length 2. Factors throw an error, but dates do not (even though there’s no date half way between two days that differ by an odd number of days).\n\nmedian(factor(1:2))\n#&gt; Error in median.default(factor(1:2)): need numeric data\nmedian(Sys.Date() + 0:1)\n#&gt; [1] \"2023-10-23\"\n\nTo be clear, the problems caused by this behaviour are quite small in practice, but it makes the analysis of median() more complex, and it makes it difficult to decide what principle you should adhere to when creating median methods for new vector classes.\n\nmedian(\"foo\")\n#&gt; [1] \"foo\"\nmedian(c(\"foo\", \"bar\"))\n#&gt; Warning in mean.default(sort(x, partial = half + 0L:1L)[half + 0L:1L]):\n#&gt; argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n#&gt; [1] NA"

    "text": "Vectorisation has two meanings: it can refer to either the interface of a function, or its implementation. We can make a precise statement about what a vectorised interface is. A function, f, is vectorised over a vector argument, x, iff f(x)[[i]] equals f(x[[i]]), i.e. we can exchange the order of subsetting and function application. This generalises naturally to more arguments: we say f is vectorised over x and y if f(x[[i]], y[[i]]) equals f(x, y)[[i]]. A function can have some arguments that are vectorised and some that are not, f(x, ...)[[i]] equals f(x[[i]], ...).\nIt is harder to define vectorised implementation. It’s necessary for a function with a vectorised implementation to have a vectorised interface, but it also must possess the property of computational efficiency. It’s hard to make this precise, but generally it means that if there is an explicit loop, that loop is written in C or C++, not in a R."

If your package works with both versions, you can submit first, making life easier for CRAN and for the maintainer of the dependency.\nUser code is less likely to be affected. If your package only works with the latest version of the dependency, then when a user upgrades your package, the dependency also must update. Upgrading multiple packages is more likely to affect user code than updating a single package.\n\nIn this pattern, you’ll learn how to write code designed to work with multiple versions of a dependency, and you’ll how to adapt your existing Travis configuration to test that you’ve got it right."

    "text": "32.2 Writing code\nSometimes there will be an easy way to change the code to work with both old and new versions of the package; do this if you can! However, in most cases, you can’t, and you’ll need an if statement that runs different code for new and old versions of the package:\n\nif (dependency_has_new_interface()) {\n  # freshly written code that works with in-development dependency\n} else {\n  # existing code that works with the currently released dependency\n}\n\n(If your freshly written code uses functions that don’t exist in the CRAN version this will generate an R CMD check NOTE when you submit it to CRAN. This is one of the few NOTEs that you can explain: just mention that it’s needed for forward/backward compatibility in your submission notes.)\nWe recommend always pulling out the check out into a function so that the logic lives in one place. This will make it much easier to pull it out when it’s no longer needed, and provides a good place to document why it’s needed.\nThere are three basic approaches to implement dependency_has_new_interface():\n\nCheck the version of the package. This is recommended in most cases, but requires that the dependency author use a specific version convention.\nCheck for existence of a function.\nCheck for a specific argument value, or otherwise detect that the interface has changed.\n\n\n32.2.1 Case study: tidyr\nTo make the problem concrete so we can show of some real code, lets imagine we have a package that uses tidyr::nest(). tidyr::nest() changed substantially between 0.8.3 and 1.0.0, and so we need to write code like this:\n\nif (tidyr_new_interface()) {\n  out &lt;- tidyr::nest_legacy(df, x, y, z)\n} else {\n  out &lt;- tidyr::nest(df, c(x, y, z))\n}\n\n(As described above, when submitted to CRAN this will generate a note about missing tidyr::nest_legacy() which can be explained in the submission comments.)\nTo implement tidyr_new_interface(), we need to think about three versions of tidyr:\n\n0.8.3: the version currently on CRAN with the old interface.\n0.8.99.9000: the development version with the new interface. As usualy, the fourth component is &gt;= 9000 to indicate that it’s a development version. Note, however, that the patch version is 99; this indicates that release includes breaking changes.\n1.0.0: the future CRAN version; this is the version that will be submitted to CRAN.\n\nThe main question is how to write tidyr_new_interface(). There are three options:\n\n\nCheck that the version is greater than the development version:\n\ntidyr_new_interface &lt;- function() {\n  packageVersion(\"tidyr\") &gt; \"0.8.99\"\n}\n\nThis technique works because tidyr uses the convention that the development version of backward incompatible functions contain 99 in the third (patch) component.\n\n\nIf tidyr didn’t adopt this naming convention, we could test for the existence of unnest_legacy().\n\ntidyr_new_interface1 &lt;- function() {\n  exists(\"unnest_legacy\", asNamespace(\"tidyr\"))\n}\n\n\n\nIf the interface change was more subtle, you might have to think more creatively. If the package uses the lifecycle system, one approach would be to test for the presence of deprecated() in the function arguments:\n\ntidyr_new_interface2 &lt;- function() {\n  identical(formals(tidyr::unnest)$.drop, quote(deprecated()))\n}\n\n\n\nAll these approaches are reasonably fast, so it’s unlikely they’ll have any impact on performance unless called in a very tight loop.\n\nbench::mark(\n  version = tidyr_new_interface(),\n  exists =  tidyr_new_interface1(),\n  formals = tidyr_new_interface2() \n)[1:5]\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 5\n#&gt;   expression      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc\n#&gt;   &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;bch:byt&gt;\n#&gt; 1 version       504µs  593.6µs     1676.    4.01KB\n#&gt; 2 exists          3µs    4.1µs   226266.    3.29MB\n#&gt; 3 formals       1.5µs      2µs   422406.        0B\n\nIf you do need to use packageVersion() inside a performance sensitive function, I recommend caching the result in .onLoad() (which, by convention, lives in zzz.R). There a few ways to do this; but the following block shows one approach that matches the function interface I used above:\n\ntidyr_new_interface &lt;- function() FALSE\n.onLoad &lt;- function(...) {\n  if (utils::packageVersion(\"tidyr\") &gt; \"0.8.2\") {\n    tidyr_new_interface &lt;&lt;- function() TRUE\n  }\n}"

However, I think it dilutes a function to be both used for plotting and for computing so should be best avoided in newer code.\n\n33.4.5 Use the print() method\nAn alternative approach would be to always return the computation, and instead perform the output in the print() method.\nOf course ggplot2 isn’t perfect: it creates an object that specifies the plot, but there’s no easy way to extract the underlying computation so if you’ve used geom_smooth() to add lines of best fit, there’s no way to extract the values. Again, you can see the results, but you can’t touch them, which is very frustrating!\n\n33.4.6 Make easy to undo\nIf all of the above techniques fail, you should at least make the side-effect easy to undo. A use technique to do this is to make sure that the function returns the previous values, and that it can take it’s own input.\nThis is how options() and par() work. You obviously can’t eliminate those functions because their complete purpose is have global changes! But they are designed in such away that you can easily undo their operation, making it possible to apply on a local basis.\nThere are two key ideas that make these functions easy to undo:\n\n\nThey invisibly return the previous values as a list:\n\noptions(my_option = 1)\nold &lt;- options(my_option = 2)\nstr(old)\n#&gt; List of 1\n#&gt;  $ my_option: num 1\n\n\n\nInstead of n named arguments, they can take a single named list:\n\nold &lt;- options(list(my_option1 = 1, my_option2 = 2))\n\n(I wouldn’t recommend copying this technique, but I’d instead recommend always taking a single named list. This makes the function because it has a single way to call it and makes it easy to extend the API in the future, as discussed in Chapter 23)\n\n\nTogether, this means that you easily can set options temporarily.:\n\ngetOption(\"my_option1\")\n#&gt; [1] 1\n\nold &lt;- options(my_option1 = 10)\ngetOption(\"my_option1\")\n#&gt; [1] 10\noptions(old)\n\ngetOption(\"my_option1\")\n#&gt; [1] 1\n\nIf temporarily setting options in a function, you should always restore the previous values using on.exit(): this ensures that the code is run regardless of how the function exits."

    "text": "34.1 What’s the problem?\nThere are no limits to what an function or script can do. After you call draw_plot() or source(\"analyse-data.R\"), you could discover that all the variables in your global environment have been deleted, or that 1000 new files have been created on your desktop. But these actions would be surprising, because generally you expect the impact of a function (or script) to be as limited as possible. Collectively, we call such side-effects “spooky actions” because the connection between action (calling a function or sourcing a script) and result (deleting objects or upgrading packages) is surprising. It’s like flipping a light-switch and discovering that the shower starts running, or having a poltergeist that rearranges the contents of your kitchen cupboards when you’re not looking.\nDeleting variables and creating files on your desktop are obviously surprising even if you’ve only just started using R. But there are other actions that are less obviously destructive, and only start to become surprising as your mental model of R matures. These include actions like:\n\nAttaching packages with library(). For example, ggplot2::geom_map() used to call library(maps) in order to make map data available to the function. This seems harmless, but if you were using purrr, it would break map() map() would now refer to maps::map() rather than purrr::map(). Because of functions in different packages can have the same name, attaching a package can change the behaviour of existing code.\nInstalling packages with install.packages(). If a script needs dplyr to work, and it’s not installed, it seems polite to install it on behalf of the user. But installing a new package can upgrade existing packages, which might break code in other projects. Install a package is a potentially destructive operation which should be done with care.\nDeleting objects in the global environment with rm(list = ls()). This might seem like a good way to reset the environment so that your script can run cleanly. But if someone else source()s your script, it will delete objects that might be important to them. (Of course, you’d hope that all of those objects could easily be recreated from another script, but that is not always the case).\n\nBecause R doesn’t constrain the potential scope of functions and scripts, you have to. By avoiding these actions, you will create code that is less surprising to other R users. At first, this might seem like tedious busywork. You might find that spooky action is convenient in the moment, and you might convince yourself that it’s necessary or a good idea. But as you share your code with more people and run more code that has been shared with you1, you’ll find spooky action to get more and more surprising and frustrating."

    "text": "34.2 What precisely is a spooky action?\nWe can make the notion of spooky action precise by thinking about trees. Code should only affect the tree beneath where it lives, so any action that reaches up, or across, the tree is a spooky action.\nThere are two important types of trees to consider:\n\n\nThe tree formed by files and directories. A script should only read from and write to directories beneath the directory where it lives. This explains why you shouldn’t install packages (because the package library usually lives elsewhere), and also explains why you shouldn’t create files on the desktop.\nThis rule can be relaxed in two small ways. Firstly, if the script lives in a project, it’s ok to read from and write to anywhere in the project (i.e. a file in R/ can read from data-raw/ and write to data/). Secondly, it’s always ok to write to the session specific temporary directory, tempdir(). This directory is automatically deleted when R closes, so does not have any lasting effects.\n\nThe tree of environments created by function calls. A function should only create and modify variables in its own environment or environments that it creates (typically by calling other functions). This explains why you shouldn’t attach packages (because that changes the search path), why you shouldn’t delete variables with rm(list = ls()), or assign to variables that you didn’t create with &lt;&lt;-."

    "text": "34.3 How can I remediate spooky actions?\nIf you have read the above cautions, and still want to proceed, there are three ways you can make the spooky action as safe as possible:\n\nAllow the user to control the scope.\nMake the action less spooky by giving it a name that clearly describes what it will do.\nExplicitly check with the user before proceeding with the action.\nAdvertise what’s happening, so while the action might still be spooky, at least it isn’t surprising.\n\n\n34.3.1 Parameterise the action\nThe first technique is to allow the user to control where the action will occur. For example, instead of save_output_desktop(), you would write save_output(path), and require that the user provide the path.\n\n34.3.2 Advertise the action with a clear name\nIf you can’t parameterise the action, make it clear what’s going to happen from the outside. It is fine for function or scripts to have actions outside of their usual trees as long as it is implicit in the name:\n\nIt’s ok for &lt;- to modify the global environment, because that is its one job, and it’s obvious from the name (once you’ve learned about &lt;-, which happens very early). Similarly, it’s ok for save_output_to_desktop() to create files in on the desktop, or copy_to_clipboard() to copy text to the clipboard, because the action is clear from the name.\nIt’s fine for install.packages() to modify files outside of the current working directory because it’s designed specifically to install packages. Similarly, it’s ok for source(\"class-setup.R\") to install packages because the intent of a setup script is to get your computer into the same state as someone else’s.\n\nHere, it’s the name of the function or script that is really important. As soon as you\nNote that it’s the name that’s important - it’s fine for install.packages() to install packages, but it’s not ok as soon as it’s hidden behind even a very simple wrapper:\n\ncurrent_time &lt;- function() {\n  if (!requireNamespace(\"lubridate\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n    install.packages(\"lubridate\")\n  }\n  lubridate::now()\n}\ncurrent_time()\n#&gt; [1] \"2023-10-23 12:50:16 UTC\"\n\n\n34.3.3 Ask for confirmation\nIf you can’t parameterise the operation, and need to perform it from somewhere deep within the cope, make sure to confirm with the user before performing the action. The code below shows how you might do so when installing a package:\n\ninstall_if_needed &lt;- function(package) {\n  if (requireNamespace(package, quietly = TRUE)) {\n    return(invisible(TRUE))\n  }\n  \n  if (!interactive()) {\n    stop(package, \" is not installed\", call. = FALSE)\n  }\n  \n  title &lt;- paste0(package, \" is not installed. Do you wish to install now?\")\n  if (menu(c(\"Yes\", \"No\"), title = title) != 1) {\n    stop(\"Confirmation not received\", call. = FALSE)\n  }\n  \n  invisible(TRUE)\n}\n\nNote the use of interactive() here: if the user is not in an interactive setting (i.e. the code is being run with Rscript) and we can not get explicit confirmation, we shouldn’t make any changes. Also that all failures are errors: this ensures that the remainder of the function or script does not run if the user doesn’t confirm.\nIdeally this function would also clearly describe the consequences of your decision. For example, it would be nice to know if it will download a significant amount of data (since you might want to wait until your at a fast connection if downloading a 1 Gb data package), or if it will upgrade existing packages (since that might break other code).\nWriting code that checks with the user requires some care, and it’s easy to get the details wrong. That’s why it’s better to prefer one of the prior techniques.\n\n34.3.4 Advertise the side-effects\nIf you can’t get explicit confirmation from the user, at the very minimum you should clearly advertise what is happening. For example, when you call install.packages() it notifies you:\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n#&gt; Installing package into ‘/Users/hadley/R’\n#&gt; (as ‘lib’ is unspecified)\n#&gt; Trying URL 'https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.5/dplyr_0.8.0.1.tgz'\n#&gt; Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 6587031 bytes (6.3 MB)\n#&gt; ==================================================\n#&gt; downloaded 6.3 MB\n\nHowever, this message could do with some work:\n\nIt says installing “package”, without specifying which package (so if this is called inside another function it won’t be informative).\nIt doesn’t notify me which dependencies it’s also going to update.\nIt notifies me of the url it’s downloading from, which I don’t care about, and it only notifies me about the size when it’s finished downloading, by which time it too late to stop it.\n\nI would instead write something like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n#&gt; Installing package dplyr to `/Users/hadley/R`\n#&gt; Also installing 3 dependencies: glue, rlang, R6\n\nWe’ll come back to the issue of informing the user in …"

This eliminates all spooky action:\n\nsaveRDS(x, \"x.rds\")\nx &lt;- readRDS(\"x.rds\")\n\n\nunlink(\"x.rds\")\n\n(readr provides readr::read_rds() and readr::write_rds() if the inconsistent naming conventions bother you like they bother me.)\n\n34.4.2 usethis\nThe usethis package is designed to support the process of developing a package of R code. It automates many of tedious setup steps by providing function like use_r() or use_test(). Many usethis functions modify the DESCRIPTION and create other files. usethis makes these actions as pedestrian as possible by:\n\nMaking it clear that the entire package is designed for the purpose of creating and modifying files, and the purpose of each function is clearly encoded in its named.\n\nFor any potential risky operation, e.g. overwriting an existing file, usethis explicitly asks for confirmation from the user. To make it harder to “click” through prompts without reading them, usethis uses random prompts in a random ordering.\n\nusethis::ui_yeah(\"Do you want to proceed?\")\n#&gt; Do you want to proceed?\n#&gt; \n#&gt; 1: Absolutely not\n#&gt; 2: Not now\n#&gt; 3: I agree\n\nusethis also works in concert with git to make sure that change are captured in a way that can easily be undone.\n\n\nWhen you call it, every usethis function describes what it is doing as it it doing it:\n\nusethis::create_package(\"mypackage\", open = FALSE)\n#&gt; ✔ Creating 'mypackage'\n#&gt; ✔ Setting active project to 'mypackage'\n#&gt; ✔ Creating 'R/'\n#&gt; ✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'\n#&gt; ✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'\n#&gt; ✔ Writing 'mypackage.Rproj'\n#&gt; ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'\n#&gt; ✔ Adding '^mypackage\\\\.Rproj$', '^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n\nThis is important, but it’s not clear how impactful it is because many functions produce enough output that reading through it all seems onerous and so generally most people don’t read it.\n\n\n34.4.3 &lt;&lt;-\n\nIf you haven’t heard of &lt;&lt;-, the super-assignment operator, before, feel free to skip this section as it’s an advanced technique that has relatively limited applications. They’re most important in the context of functionals, which you can read more about in Advanced R.\n&lt;&lt;- is safe if you use it to modify a variable in an environment that you control. For example, the following code creates a function that counts the number of times it is called. The use of &lt;&lt;- is safe because it only affects the environment created by make_counter(), not an external environment.\n\nmake_counter &lt;- function() {\n  i &lt;- 0\n  function() {\n    i &lt;&lt;- i + 1\n    i\n  }\n}\nc1 &lt;- make_counter()\nc2 &lt;- make_counter()\nc1()\n#&gt; [1] 1\nc1()\n#&gt; [1] 2\nc2()\n#&gt; [1] 1\n\nA more common use of &lt;&lt;- is to break one of the limitations of map()2 and use it like a for loop to iteratively modify input. For example, imagine you want to compute a cumulative sum. That’s straightforward to write with a for loop:\n\nx &lt;- rpois(10, 10)\n\nout &lt;- numeric(length(x))\nfor (i in seq_along(x)) {\n  if (i == 1) {\n    out[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]]\n  } else {\n    out[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]] + out[[i - 1]]\n  }\n}\n\nrbind(x, out)\n#&gt;     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n#&gt; x      3    9    9   10    8   10    7   10   14    10\n#&gt; out    3   12   21   31   39   49   56   66   80    90\n\nA simple transformation from to use map() doesn’t work:\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nout &lt;- numeric(length(x))\nmap_dbl(seq_along(x), function(i) {\n  if (i == 1) {\n    out[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]]\n  } else {\n    out[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]] + out[[i - 1]]\n  }\n})\n#&gt;  [1]  3  9  9 10  8 10  7 10 14 10\n\nBecause the modification of out is happening inside of a function, R creates a copy of out (this is called copy-on-modify principle). Instead we need to use &lt;&lt;- to reach outside of the function to modify the outer out:\n\nmap_dbl(seq_along(x), function(i) {\n  if (i == 1) {\n    out[[i]] &lt;&lt;- x[[i]]\n  } else {\n    out[[i]] &lt;&lt;- x[[i]] + out[[i - 1]]\n  }\n})\n#&gt;  [1]  3 12 21 31 39 49 56 66 80 90\n\nThis use of &lt;&lt;- is a spooky action because we’re reaching up the tree of environments to modify an object created outside of the function. In this case, however, there’s no point in using map(): the point of those functions is to restrict what you can do compared to a for loop so that your code is easier to understand. R for data science has other examples of for loops that could be rewritten with map(), but shouldn’t be.\nNote that we could still wrap this code into a function to eliminate the spooky action:\n\ncumsum2 &lt;- function(x) {\n  out &lt;- numeric(length(x))\n  map_dbl(seq_along(x), function(i) {\n    if (i == 1) {\n      out[[i]] &lt;&lt;- x[[i]]\n    } else {\n      out[[i]] &lt;&lt;- x[[i]] + out[[i - 1]]\n    }\n  })\n  out\n}\n\nThis eliminates the spooky action because it’s now modifying an object that the function “owns”, but I still wouldn’t recommend it, as the use of map() and &lt;&lt;- only increases complexity for no gain compared to the use of a for loop.\n\n34.4.4 assign() in a for loop\nIt’s not uncommon for people to ask how to create multiple objects from for a loop. For example, maybe you have a vector of file names, and want to read each file into an individual object. With some effort you typically discover assign():\n\npaths &lt;- c(\"a.csv\", \"b.csv\", \"c.csv\")\nnames(paths) &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nfor (i in seq_along(paths)) {\n  assign(names(paths)[[i]], read.csv(paths[[i]]))\n}\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that it does not facilitate composition. For example, imagine that you now wanted to figure out how many rows are in each of the data frames. Now you need to learn how to loop over a series of objects, where the name of the object is stored in a character vector. With some work, you might discover get() and write:\n\nlengths &lt;- numeric(length(names))\nfor (i in seq_along(paths)) {\n  lengths[[i]] &lt;- nrow(get(names(paths)[[i]]))\n}\n\nThis approach is not necessarily bad in and of itself3, but it tends to lead you down a high-friction path. Instead, if you learn a little about lists and functional programming techniques (e.g. with purrr), you’ll be able to write code like this:\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nfiles &lt;- map(paths, read.csv)\nlengths &lt;- map_int(files, nrow)\n\nThis obviously requires that you learn some new tools - but learning about map() and map_int() will pay off in many more situations than learning about assign() and get(). And because you can reuse map() and friends in many places, you’ll find that they get easier and easier to use over time.\nIt would certainly be possible to build tools in purrr to avoid having to learn about assign() and get() and to provide a polished interface for working with character vectors containing object names. But such functions would need to reach up the tree of environments, so would violate the “spooky action” principle, and thus I believe are best avoided."

That’s why we recommend only using an error constructor for repeated errors.\nIt gives more precise control over error handling with tryCatch(). This is particularly useful in packages because you may be able to give more useful high-level error mesasges by wrapping a specific low-level error.\nAs you start using this technique for more error messages you can create a hierarchy of errors that allows you to borrow behaviour, reducing the amount of code you need to write.\nOnce you have identified all the errors that can be thrown by a function, you can add a @section Throws: to the documentation that precisely describes the possible failure modes."

The primary goal of this test is to ensure that the error constructor generates a message that is useful to humans, which you can not automate. This means that you can not use a unit test (because the desired output is not known) and instead you need to use a regression test, so you can ensure that the message does not change unexpectedly. For that reason the best approach is usually to use verify_output(), e.g.:\n\ntest_that(\"stop_not_found() generates useful error message\", {\n  verify_output(test_path(\"test-stop-not-found.txt\"), {\n    stop_not_found(\"a.csv\")\n  })\n})\n\nThis is useful for pull requests because verify_output() generates a complete error messages in a text file that can easily be read and reviewed.\nIf your error has multiple arguments, or your conditionMessage() method contains if statements, you should generally attempt to cover them all in a test case.\n\n36.4.2 Test usage\nNow that you have an error constructor, you’ll need to slightly change how you test your functions that use the error constructor. For example, take this imaginary example for reading a file into a single string:\n\nread_lines &lt;- function(x) {\n  if (!file.exists(x)) {\n    stop_not_found(x)\n  }\n  paste0(readLines(x), collapse = \"\\n\")\n}\n\nPreviously, you might have written:\n\nexpect_error(read_lines(\"missing-file.txt\"), \"not found\")\n\nBut, now as you see, testthat gives you a warning that suggests you need to use the class argument instead:\n\nexpect_error(read_lines(\"missing-file.txt\"), class = \"fs_error_not_found\")\n\nThis is less fragile because you can now change the error message without having to worry about breaking existing tests.\nIf you also want to check components of the error object, note that expect_error() returns it:\n\ncnd &lt;- expect_error(read_lines(\"missing-file.txt\"), class = \"fs_error_not_found\")\nexpect_equal(cnd$path, \"missing-file.txt\")\n\nI don’t think this level of testing is generally important, so you should only use it because the error generation code is complex conditions, or you have identified a bug."

    "text": "36.5 Error hierarchies\nAs you start writing more and more error constructors, you may notice that you are starting to share code between them because the errors form a natural hierarchy. To take advantage of this hierarchy to reduce the amount of code you need to write, you can make the errors subclassable by adding ... and class arguments:\n\nstop_not_found &lt;- function(path, ..., class = character()) {\n  abort(\n    .subclass = c(class, \"fs_error_not_found\"),\n    path = path\n  )\n}\n\nThen the subclasses can call this constructor, and the problem becomes one of S3 class design. We currently have little experience with this, so use with caution."
